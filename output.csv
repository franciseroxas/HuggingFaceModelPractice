0,Scientists study Leonardo's DNA in art.,"Scientists are attempting to uncover the genetic secrets of Leonardo da Vinci[COMMA] the renowned Renaissance polymath[COMMA] through a project called the Leonardo da Vinci Project. Despite the lack of verified remains[COMMA] researchers are sampling artifacts associated with Leonardo[COMMA] such as paintings and letters[COMMA] to find DNA.

This method could help assemble his genome if similar sequences are found in other artifacts. The research[COMMA] led by Dr. Norberto Gonzalez-Juarbe and Dr. Charles Lee[COMMA] aims to provide insights into Leonardo's visual acuity and potentially his biological advantages. The findings could help settle the debate over whether ""Holy Child"" was indeed created by Leonardo and confirm the authenticity of other disputed works.
